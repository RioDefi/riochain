## RioChain dApps

There are two ways to build dapps on RioChain. The first one is to build a module that run as a native module on RioChain. The second way is to build it based on the comming smart contract platform.

To build a native dApp module on RioChain, you need to fork RioChain first, then have the pull request to the RioChain main repo. The dev team will review the code carefully and decide that if it's possible to allow those modules merged into the main repo.

This is a compromised way to build a dapp, but maybe it's the best way to cooperate with third-party teams for now.
